Information for people new to EngineerBetter.

If this is you, then welcome! We'll keep this succinct so information is easier to find - hopefully the nice, friendly welcome has been effected via other media.

## Onboarding process

You should have been assigned an 'onboarding guide' (if you're unlucky, it'll be [Deejay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danieljoneseb/)) who will be your point-of-contact if you need help.

Generally speaking, the flow of events is something like:

1. You get a Macbook
1. You probably won't get a pile of swag, because it's all in storage (pandemic, and all that)
1. If you're remote, you should install Zoom as a priority, so that we can help via video call
1. You get an email to your personal address, inviting you to your EngineerBetter Google Workspace account. There'll be a password reset.
1. Log into your EngineerBetter GMail account
1. See an invite to a Pivotal Tracker onboarding project with your name on
1. Sign up to Pivotal Tracker, look at the backlog, and get your guide to explain it
1. Work through the backlog

If you're curious what kind of stories are in the onboarding backlog, you can take a look in the [`prolific` directory](/prolific/) of this repository.

### Why are the tasks in Pivotal Tracker?

Pivotal Tracker embodies a methodology that we're keen to espouse. Using Tracker enables folks to get some initial experience with it, and also allows us to express tasks in terms of their value - something that's critical to delivering useful outcomes.
