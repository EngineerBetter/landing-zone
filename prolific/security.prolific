In order to minimise the surface area of possible security breaches, we should use Google SSO whenever possible to signup to online services. Enterprise customers and our insurance company need to know the various systems we log into, and how we log into them.

Example services to use Google OAuth/SSO for include:

* Google Cloud
* Google Apps
* Float
* FreeAgent
* Slack
* Pivotal Tracker
* Hellosign
* Miro
* Zoom

## Acceptance
